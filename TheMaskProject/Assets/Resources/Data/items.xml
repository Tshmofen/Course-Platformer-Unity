            <Name>The Mask</Name>
            <Description>
                Traditional mask with large white eye sockets and no pupils.\n\n
                
                Although outwardly the eye sockets seem impenetrable, 
                the view from the inside of the mask is unobstructed. 
                Also the mask is surprisingly durable, 
                as you figured it out in a vain attempts to take it off.\n\n
                
                This strange mask emits a faint, ominous light.\n
                Maybe you can somehow use the energy hidden in this item.

            <Name>Medicine Flask</Name>
            <Description>
                Turquoise flask with paper wrapper.\n\n
                
                Some kind of herb is depicted on the paper. 
                You recognize this medical healing mixture by its characteristic scent and the depiction.
                However, the name of the herb does not occur to you in any way.\n\n

                Maybe this mixture can be used to heal small wounds?
